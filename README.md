## Introduction

Started a new class at WMCollege, called: **ALS/Additional Learning Support: Creative Computing**.

- https://www.wmcollege.ac.uk  
- https://www.wmcollege.ac.uk/courses/creative-computing/  

The class had already begun -but, I was allowed to join in 1 week late-; and, this is the 2nd week. Altogether it is a 10 week long course.

## 220124 My first class

We were introduced to using Adobe Illustrator 'vector based' software...; and, we drew both straight lines/and, too, circular...by employing the 'pen tool'.   
We also filled the shapes we created in with colours.  

I created a web page...to test if it was possible to save the .svg code pictures/and, then, display it inside of a web page; the answer is, affirmative.    
I just have to open up the saved file...; and, then, copy/paste the .svg codes into the web page: index.html.  

We started a 'new' project: Choose a country/city, and, select 2 famous landmarks. I selected: London, UK/and, The Bullet/Tate Gallery.   
Downloaded 5 internet photos related to each landmark theme...; meaning, in all I downloaded 10 photos, altogether.

Afterwards, we were told to shut off the computer...; and, fill in our ILP/Individual Learning Plan.

That was it, class finshed.

(Next, I went downstairs to visit the computer room...where I continued studying. The computers downstairs also have Adobe Illustrator software available to continue working with...)
