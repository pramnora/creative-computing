   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   
   <p class="clsPara">
    Started a new class at WMCollege, called: ALS/Additional Learning Support: Creative Computing.
   </p>

   <p class="clsPara">
    The class had already begun -but, I was allowed to join in 1 week late-; and, this is the 2nd week. 
   </p>

   <p class="clsPara">
    Altogether it is a 10 week long course: Mon 10 AM - 12:30 PM/Room: 513.

   <h3>220124/My first lesson</h3>
    <p class="clsPara">
    We were introduced to using Adobe Illustrator 'vector based' software...; and, we drew both straight lines/and, too, circular...by employing the 'pen tool'.
We also filled the shapes we created in with colours.
    </p>
   
    <p class="clsPara">
    I created a web page...to test if it was possible to save the .svg code pictures/and, then, display it inside of a web page; the answer is, affirmative.
    <br>I just have to open up the saved file...; and, then, copy/paste the .svg codes into the web page: index.html.
    </p>

    <p class="clsPara">
     -(<b>NOTE</b>: The Adobe Illustrator program itself can be used to save the file as just .svg extension;  
     <br>and, this format is viewable inside of the web browser itself...without needed to add any further HTML codes.)-
    </p>

    
   
    <p class="clsPara">
     We started a 'new' project: Choose a country/city, and, select 2 famous landmarks. I selected: London, UK/and, The Bullet/Tate Gallery.
     <br>Downloaded 5 internet photos related to each landmark theme...; meaning, in all I downloaded 10 photos, altogether.
    </p>

    <p class="clsPara">
     Afterwards, we were told to shut off the computer...; and, fill in our ILP/Individual Learning Plan.
     <br>That was it, class finshed.
    </p>

   <h3>My test SVG's</h3>
   
   <p class="clsPara">
    When class was finished, I went downstairs to visit the computer room...where I continued studying. 
    <br>-(<b>NOTE</b>: The computers downstairs also have <i>Adobe Illustrator</i> software available to continue working on.)-
    </p>
